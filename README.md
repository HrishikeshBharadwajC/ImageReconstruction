# CSE-251B-FinalProject

This is an experimental study that deals with the task of image-to-image translation. In particular, the task of reconstruction of real-life images from the transformed images is explored. We propose the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to accomplish this task. The study replicates the standard pix2pix framework and proposes a mod- ified generator architecture for the pix2pix model by making use of Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and Separable Convolutions (SC). The study also includes the use of Wasserstein GAN (with gradient penalty) and Cycle GANs. A comparative study is presented by measuring the per- formance of all the architecture on maps, facades and cityscapes dataset using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance as an evaluation metric.
